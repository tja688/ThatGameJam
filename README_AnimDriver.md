# Spine Character Animation Driver

This doc covers the quick setup for `SpineCharacterAnimDriver` and the optional editor scan tool.

## Setup

1. Add a `SkeletonAnimation` component to the character (or a child object) and assign the `SkeletonDataAsset`.
2. Add `SpineCharacterAnimDriver` to the same GameObject as `PlatformerCharacterController` (or a parent).
3. Drag the `SkeletonAnimation` reference into the driver and fill in the animation name mappings.
4. Tune thresholds and mix values if transitions feel too sharp.

## Animation Name Mapping

- Use the report generated by `Tools/Spine/Scan Character Animations`.
- Fill at least:
  - Base: `Idle`, `Run`, `JumpUp`, `Fall`, `Land`, `ClimbMove` (and `ClimbIdle` if present).
  - Overlay: `Blink` or `Breath` (optional), `UpperBody`/`Hit` if you have them.
- If names are unclear, enable the debug browser and use `[` / `]` to cycle animations.

## State Inputs Used

The driver reads from `IPlayerCharacter2DModel` (grounded, climbing, velocity, move input) via QFramework.
If the model is unavailable, it falls back to `PlatformerCharacterController` and `Rigidbody2D`.

## Debug Browser

- Enable `enableDebugBrowser` in the inspector.
- Use `[` and `]` to step through all animations on Track 0.

## Report Tool

Menu: `Tools/Spine/Scan Character Animations`

- Select a `SkeletonDataAsset` in the Project window and run the tool.
- Output file: `Assets/Art/SpineAnimationReport.md`
